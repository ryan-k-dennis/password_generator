# password_generator

A short program that generates a number of passwords (as specified by the user) of a given length. The generated passwords are pseudorandom and are saved to a .txt file in the same directory in which the program is running.

An example output in an instance where a user asked for 3 passwords with a length of 24 would be:
```
IY>H_|47;{{]xwY7B8\_*3o(
